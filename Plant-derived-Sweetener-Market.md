Increasing awareness regarding the health risks associated with high sugar consumption, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, has led consumers to opt for more natural, plant-based sweeteners. Additionally, the growing trend of clean label products, which emphasize transparency and simplicity in ingredients, further boosts the demand for plant-derived sweeteners.
